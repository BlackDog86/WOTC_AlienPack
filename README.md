## Alien Pack
This alien pack is a port of the
[original](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=577474474)
LW2 alien pack for long war 2. 

The port uses a smattering of the original LW2 code, along with additions from members of the LWOTC team who ported most of the content over into LWOTC directly. The original mod was developed to add new enemies to vanilla XCOM 2 but was never updated with WOTC compatibility. This mod aims to rectify that.

Please note that as of v0.1, the chryssalid soldier & hive queen have been removed - their AI & abilities were not changed in any signifacnt way so were essentially just 'bullet sponge' versions of the vanilla enemies. With permission I may add some of the Hive & ABA enemies to this pack for a more comprehensive & balanced experience and to give some further ability variety.

The AI of the enemies in this pack are standalone and should not have any interference with ABA / ABAI.
